We will learn how to identify the most informative genes, visualize complex high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces using methods like PCA and UMAP, and group spots into clusters representing distinct spatial domains. These steps are fundamental for interpreting the underlying biological structure of the tissue.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this exercise, you will be able to:\n\n-   Perform feature selection to identify highly variable genes (HVGs).\n-   Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and UMAP.\n-   Perform clustering to identify distinct spatial domains or cell populations.\n-   Visualize the results of dimensionality reduction and clustering in both reduced dimension space and spatial context.\n\n## Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(SpatialExperiment)\nlibrary(qs2)\nlibrary(scran) # For feature selection and clustering\nlibrary(scater) # For dimensionality reduction\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork) # For combining plots\nlibrary(bluster) # For clustering\nlibrary(escheR) # For spatial plotting\nlibrary(pheatmap) # For clustering heatmap\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Load and Prepare Data\n\nWe will start by loading the `SpatialExperiment` object and performing the necessary preprocessing steps, including subsetting for demonstration purposes, similar to the previous exercise.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the SpatialExperiment object from the .qs2 file.\nspe <- qs2::qs_read(\"results/01_spe.qs2\", nthreads = 1)\n\n# Change row names from gene IDs to gene symbols.\nrownames(spe) <- rowData(spe)$Symbol\n\n# Identify mitochondrial transcripts.\nis.mito <- rownames(spe)[grepl(\"^MT-\", rownames(spe))]\n\n# Calculate per-spot QC metrics.\nspe <- scuttle::addPerCellQCMetrics(spe, subsets = list(Mito = is.mito))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required namespace: HDF5Array\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Subsetting for Demonstration (to reduce computation time)\nset.seed(123) # for reproducibility\nnum_genes_to_keep <- 10000\nif (nrow(spe) > num_genes_to_keep) {\n  gene_indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(spe)), num_genes_to_keep)\n  spe_subset <- spe[gene_indices, ]\n} else {\n  spe_subset <- spe\n}\n\nnum_spots_to_keep <- 10000\nif (ncol(spe_subset) > num_spots_to_keep) {\n  spot_indices <- sample(seq_len(ncol(spe_subset)), num_spots_to_keep)\n  spe_subset <- spe_subset[, spot_indices]\n} else {\n  spe_subset <- spe_subset\n}\n\nspe <- spe_subset\n\n# Remove spots with NA/NaN/Inf in mitochondrial QC metrics or spatial coordinates\nna_mito_percent <- is.na(colData(spe)$subsets_Mito_percent)\nna_mito_sum <- is.na(colData(spe)$subsets_Mito_sum)\nspots_to_remove_mito <- na_mito_percent | na_mito_sum\nif (any(spots_to_remove_mito)) {\n  message(paste0(\"Removing \", sum(spots_to_remove_mito), \" spots with NA mitochondrial QC metrics.\"))\n  spe <- spe[, !spots_to_remove_mito]\n}\n\nspatial_coords <- spatialCoords(spe)\nproblematic_spatial_coords <- apply(spatial_coords, 1, function(row) any(is.na(row) | is.nan(row) | is.infinite(row)))\nif (any(problematic_spatial_coords)) {\n  message(paste0(\"Removing \", sum(problematic_spatial_coords), \" spots with NA/NaN/Inf in spatial coordinates.\"))\n  spe <- spe[, !problematic_spatial_coords]\n}\n\n# Remove spots with zero total counts, as these can cause issues with size factor calculation during normalization.\nzero_sum_spots <- colSums(counts(spe)) == 0\nif (any(zero_sum_spots)) {\n  message(paste0(\"Removing \", sum(zero_sum_spots), \" spots with zero total counts.\"))\n  spe <- spe[, !zero_sum_spots]\n}\n\n# Log-normalize counts for downstream analysis\nspe <- logNormCounts(spe)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Spatially-Aware Normalization (Optional)\nWhile `logNormCounts` provides a general-purpose normalization, specialized spatially-aware normalization methods exist (e.g., `SpaNorm` package). These methods aim to correct for technical variations while preserving true spatial biological patterns. Depending on the dataset and research question, exploring such advanced normalization techniques might be beneficial.\n\n### Size Factor Analysis\n- After log-normalization, we can inspect the computed size factors.\n- Size factors account for differences in sequencing depth between spots.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Display a summary of the calculated size factors.\nsummary(sizeFactors(spe))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.

We typically identify Highly Variable Genes (HVGs) as these are more likely to distinguish different cell types or spatial domains.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Model gene variance to identify highly variable genes.\n# This function fits a trend to the technical noise and calculates biological variance.\ndec <- modelGeneVar(spe)\n\n# Select the top N highly variable genes.\n# The number of HVGs can influence downstream dimensionality reduction and clustering.\nhvg <- getTopHVGs(dec, n = 2000) # Selecting top 2000 HVGs\n\n# Store HVG information in rowData\nrowData(spe)$hvg <- rowData(spe)$Symbol %in% hvg\n\n# Display the number of HVGs identified\nsum(rowData(spe)$hvg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2000\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Visualize the mean-variance relationship and the fitted trend.\n# This plot helps to understand how gene variability changes with expression level.\nplot(dec$mean, dec$total,\n  xlab = \"Mean expression (log-counts)\",\n  ylab = \"Total variance (log-counts)\",\n  main = \"Mean-Variance Trend\"\n)\ncurve(metadata(dec)$trend(x), add = TRUE, col = \"dodgerblue\", lwd = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](day1-3_feature_dimred_cluster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n**Why is it important to perform feature selection (e.g., identifying HVGs) before dimensionality reduction and clustering in spatial transcriptomics data?**\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Answer\n\nFeature selection is important for several reasons:\n\n-   **Noise Reduction:** It helps to filter out genes that show little variation and are likely dominated by technical noise, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio.\n-   **Computational Efficiency:** Reducing the number of features (genes) significantly decreases the computational burden for subsequent steps like dimensionality reduction and clustering, especially with large datasets.\n-   **Improved Interpretation:** By focusing on genes with high biological variability, we are more likely to identify meaningful biological patterns and distinctions between cell types or spatial domains.\n-   **Mitigating the Curse of Dimensionality:** High-dimensional data can make it difficult for algorithms to find meaningful patterns; feature selection helps alleviate this.\n:::\n\n### Spatially Variable Genes (SVGs)\n\nBeyond simply highly variable genes, in spatial transcriptomics, we are often interested in genes whose expression patterns vary significantly across the spatial dimensions. These are known as Spatially Variable Genes (SVGs).\n\nIdentifying SVGs can reveal genes that define distinct tissue regions, cell types, or biological processes with specific spatial localization.\n\nWhile several advanced methods and packages exist for SVG identification (e.g., `nnSVG`, `SPARK-X`, `Giotto`), implementing a full SVG analysis is beyond the scope of this introductory exercise. However, it's important to be aware of this concept as a crucial step in spatial data analysis.\n\n## Question 1.2\n\n**How do Spatially Variable Genes (SVGs) differ from Highly Variable Genes (HVGs), and why is identifying SVGs particularly important in spatial transcriptomics?**\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Answer\n\n-   **HVGs (Highly Variable Genes):** Genes that show high variability in expression across all spots/cells in a dataset, regardless of their spatial location. They are informative for distinguishing cell types or states in a general sense.\n-   **SVGs (Spatially Variable Genes):** Genes whose expression levels exhibit a non-random, structured pattern across the spatial coordinates of the tissue. Their variability is specifically linked to their position.\n\nIdentifying SVGs is particularly important in spatial transcriptomics because:\n\n-   **Reveals Spatial Organization:** SVGs directly highlight genes that contribute to the spatial organization of the tissue, defining distinct anatomical regions or functional domains.\n-   **Biological Insights:** They can pinpoint genes involved in cell-cell communication, developmental gradients, or disease progression within a tissue context.\n-   **Targeted Analysis:** SVGs can be used for more targeted downstream analysis, focusing on genes that are most relevant to the spatial biology of interest.\n:::\n\n## Dimensionality Reduction\n\nDimensionality reduction techniques project high-dimensional gene expression data into a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to visualize and analyze. This step is essential for identifying global patterns and preparing data for clustering.\n\n### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\nPCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the data into a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Run PCA on the highly variable genes.\n# We use the 'ncomponents' argument to specify the number of principal components to retain.\nspe <- runPCA(spe, ncomponents = 50, subset_row = rowData(spe)$hvg)\n\n# Visualize the explained variance by each principal component.\n# This helps in determining how many PCs capture most of the variance.\nplot(attr(reducedDim(spe, \"PCA\"), \"percentVar\"),\n  xlab = \"PC\", ylab = \"Proportion of variance explained\",\n  main = \"PCA Scree Plot\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](day1-3_feature_dimred_cluster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Visualize the PCA embedding.\n# This helps to see the main sources of variation in the data.\nplotPCA(spe, colour_by = \"sum\") +\n  ggtitle(\"PCA colored by Library Size\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](day1-3_feature_dimred_cluster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2\n\n**Based on the PCA scree plot, how would you determine an appropriate number of principal components to retain for downstream analysis? What are the trade-offs of choosing too few or too many PCs?**\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Answer\n\nAn appropriate number of principal components (PCs) can often be determined by looking for an \"elbow point\" in the scree plot, where the explained variance starts to level off. This point suggests that subsequent PCs explain much less variance and might represent noise rather than meaningful biological signal.\n\n-   **Too few PCs:** Might lead to a loss of important biological signal, as significant sources of variation could be discarded.\n-   **Too many PCs:** Can retain too much noise, potentially obscuring true biological patterns and increasing computational complexity for downstream steps like clustering.\n:::\n\n### t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n\nt-SNE is another non-linear dimensionality reduction technique particularly well-suited for visualizing high-dimensional datasets. It aims to place similar data points close together in a low-dimensional map, while dissimilar points are placed far apart. It is especially good at revealing local structures in the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Run t-SNE on the PCA-reduced data.\n# Similar to UMAP, using PCA output as input to t-SNE is a common practice.\nspe <- runTSNE(spe, dimred = \"PCA\")\n\n# Visualize the t-SNE embedding.\nplotTSNE(spe, colour_by = \"sum\") +\n  ggtitle(\"t-SNE colored by Library Size\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](day1-3_feature_dimred_cluster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2.2\n\n**How does t-SNE differ from UMAP in its approach to dimensionality reduction, and what are the implications for interpreting their respective visualizations?**\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Answer\n\nt-SNE and UMAP are both non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques that aim to preserve local and global data structures. However, they differ in their underlying algorithms and how they balance these aspects:\n\n-   **t-SNE:** Focuses heavily on preserving local neighborhoods. It tends to create tightly packed clusters, but the distances between clusters in a t-SNE plot are often not meaningful. It can be computationally more intensive for very large datasets.\n-   **UMAP:** Aims to preserve both local and global structures more effectively than t-SNE. Distances between clusters in a UMAP plot are generally considered more meaningful, and it is often faster and scales better to larger datasets.\n\n**Implications for interpretation:**\n\n-   **t-SNE:** Excellent for revealing distinct, compact clusters. However, the relative sizes of clusters and distances between them should be interpreted with caution.\n-   **UMAP:** Often provides a more faithful representation of the overall data topology, making inter-cluster distances and relative densities more interpretable. It can sometimes produce more diffuse clusters than t-SNE.\n\nChoosing between them often depends on the specific goals of the visualization and the characteristics of the data.\n:::\n\n### Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)\n\nUMAP is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly effective at preserving both local and global data structure, making it popular for visualizing complex single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Run UMAP on the PCA-reduced data.\n# Using PCA output as input to UMAP is a common practice to denoise the data first.\nspe <- runUMAP(spe, dimred = \"PCA\")\n\n# Visualize the UMAP embedding.\n# We can color the points by various metadata, for example, by library size.\nplotUMAP(spe, colour_by = \"sum\") +\n  ggtitle(\"UMAP colored by Library Size\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](day1-3_feature_dimred_cluster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 3\n\n**Compare and contrast PCA and UMAP. In what scenarios would you prefer to use one over the other for visualizing spatial transcriptomics data?**\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Answer\n\n-   **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** A linear method that identifies directions of maximal variance. It's good for understanding global variance and can be interpreted as a denoising step. It preserves large-scale structures but can compress complex non-linear relationships.\n-   **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):** A non-linear method that aims to preserve both local and global data structure. It's excellent for visualizing complex, high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D, often revealing distinct clusters more clearly.\n\n**When to use which:**\n\n-   **Prefer PCA:** For initial data exploration, denoising, and when linearity is assumed or desired. It's also useful for understanding the main sources of variation.\n-   **Prefer UMAP:** For visualizing complex relationships, identifying distinct clusters, and when non-linear structures are expected. It's often used after PCA to further reduce dimensions for visualization.\n\nFor spatial transcriptomics, UMAP is often preferred for visualization due to its ability to reveal distinct spatial domains or cell types that might have non-linear relationships in gene expression.\n:::\n\n## Clustering\n\nClustering aims to group spots with similar gene expression profiles, which can correspond to distinct cell types or tissue regions. We will use a graph-based clustering approach, which is common in single-cell and spatial analyses. Other methods like k-means or hierarchical clustering are also available but may have different assumptions or computational properties.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Build a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph based on the PCA-reduced data.\n# The k parameter defines the number of nearest neighbors to consider.\nsnn_graph <- buildSNNGraph(spe, k = 10, use.dimred = \"PCA\")\n\n# Perform clustering on the SNN graph using the Walktrap algorithm.\n# The 'cluster_walktrap' function from igraph (used via bluster) is a common choice.\nclusters <- igraph::cluster_walktrap(snn_graph)$membership\n\n# Add the cluster assignments to the colData of the SpatialExperiment object.\ncolData(spe)$clusters <- factor(clusters)\n\n# Display the number of spots in each cluster\ntable(colData(spe)$clusters)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11 \n 235 1998 2062  991  512  733 1357 1366  458  221   67 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Evaluating Cluster Quality with Silhouette Scores\n# Silhouette scores provide a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster\n# compared to other clusters.

What are the challenges in interpreting clusters in a spatial context?**\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Answer\n\nDetermining the optimal number of clusters is often an iterative process and can involve:\n\n-   **Visual Inspection:** Plotting clusters on UMAP and in spatial coordinates to see if they form coherent groups.\n-   **Biological Knowledge:** Aligning clusters with known tissue structures or cell types.\n-   **Statistical Metrics:** Using metrics like silhouette scores, Davies-Bouldin index, or gap statistics. The `bluster` package, for instance, provides functions like `pairwiseRand` or `pairwiseJaccard` to compare different clusterings, and `silhouette` from `cluster` package can be used to evaluate cluster cohesion and separation. While a full implementation is beyond this exercise, these metrics provide quantitative ways to assess cluster quality.\n-   **Resolution Parameter:** For graph-based clustering, adjusting the resolution parameter can influence the number of clusters.\n\n**Challenges in interpreting clusters in a spatial context:**\n\n-   **Spatial Heterogeneity:** Clusters might not always correspond to perfectly contiguous spatial regions, especially if cell types are intermingled.\n-   **Technical Artifacts:** Clusters might sometimes reflect technical variations (e.g., batch effects, poor quality regions) rather than true biological differences.\n-   **Resolution Mismatch:** The resolution of clustering might not perfectly match the biological resolution of the tissue.\n-   **Defining Boundaries:** It can be challenging to define clear boundaries between spatially adjacent clusters.\n:::\n\n## Marker Gene Identification\n\nAfter identifying clusters, a crucial step is to characterize them by finding marker genes – genes that are highly expressed or uniquely expressed in one cluster compared to others.
