Note that you will need administrator rights, and that if you are using Windows, you need the latest version of Windows 10.\n\nThe command to run the environment required for this course looks like this (in a terminal):\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Modify the script\nThe home directory within the container is mounted to your current directory (`$PWD`), if you want to change this behaviour, modify the path after `-v` to the working directory on your computer before running it.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ndocker run \\\n--rm \\\n-p 8787:8787 \\\n-e PASSWORD=test \\\n-v $PWD:/home/rstudio \\\nsibswiss/training-seq-spatial-transcriptomics-rstudio\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf this command has run successfully, approach Rstudio server like this:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8787\n```\n\nCopy this URL into your browser. If you used the snippet above, the credentials will be:\n\n- **Username:** `rstudio`\n- **Password:** `test`\n\nGreat! Now you will be able to use Rstudio with all required installations.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## About the options\nThe option `-v` mounts a local directory in your computer to the directory `/home/rstudio` in the docker container ('rstudio' is the default user for Rstudio containers). In that way, you have files available both in the container and on your computer. Use this directory on your computer. Change the first path to a path on your computer that you want to use as a working directory.\n\nThe part `sibswiss/training-seq-spatial-transcriptomics-rstudio` is the image we are going to load into the container. The image contains all the information about software and dependencies needed for this course. When you run this command for the first time it will download the image. Once it's on your computer, it will start immediately.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Create a project\n\nNow that you have access to an environment with the required installations, we will set up a project in a new directory. On the top right choose the button **Project (None)** and select **New Project...**\n\n![](../assets/images/create_new_project.png){width=200}\n\nContinue by choosing **New Directory**\n\n![](../assets/images/choose_new_directory.png){width=300}\n\nAs project type select **New Project**\n\n![](../assets/images/choose_new_project.png){width=300}\n\nFinally, type in the project name. This should be `spatial_course`. Finish by clicking **Create Project**.\n\n![](../assets/images/define_directory_name.png){width=300}\n\n**We have setup a project and a project directory (it is in `/home/rstudio/spatial_course`).**\n",
