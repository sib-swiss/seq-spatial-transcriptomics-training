# Table 4: Promoter-Focused Analysis

Analysis specifically focused on promoter regions using H3K4me3 as the primary marker.

::: {.scroll-table}

| Category | ATAC-seq | H3K4me3 | RNA-seq | DNAme (CpG Promoter) | Dist. to TSS | Interpretation |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|

# Table 5: Simplified Three-Factor Analysis

Basic analysis using just ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and DNA methylation.

::: {.scroll-table}

| Category | ATAC-seq | RNA-seq | DNAme (CpG Promoter) | Dist. to TSS | Interpretation |
|----------|----------|---------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Active Gene/Element** | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | <2500 bp / >2500 bp | Open chromatin, high gene expression, and low DNA methylation. This is the classic signature of an actively transcribed gene (often proximal) or a highly active regulatory element (can be distal). |
| **Repressed Gene/Element** | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | <2500 bp / >2500 bp | Closed chromatin, low/no gene expression, and high DNA methylation. This indicates a stably silenced gene or an inactive regulatory element. Can be proximal or distal. |
| **Poised/Primed Region** | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | ∼ Low/No | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | <2500 bp / >2500 bp | Open chromatin, but low/no gene expression, and low DNA methylation. The region is accessible, and DNA is unmethylated, suggesting it's "ready" for activation but not currently expressing. Can be proximal (poised promoter) or distal (poised enhancer). |
| **Incongruent/Complex** | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | Variable | <2500 bp / >2500 bp | Closed chromatin, but high gene expression. This is an unusual state. It might suggest very efficient transcription from a less accessible promoter, or a regulatory mechanism (e.g., enhancer) acting from a distance which is not reflected by local accessibility. Requires deeper investigation. |
| **Silent/Inactive Region** | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | ∼ No Expression | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | <2500 bp / >2500 bp | Closed chromatin, no gene expression, and high DNA methylation. Represents a fully repressed and inaccessible genomic region, such as silent heterochromatin. Can be proximal or distal. |
| **Lost Accessibility, Unchanged RNA** | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | ∼ No Change | Variable | <2500 bp / >2500 bp | Chromatin becomes less accessible, but gene expression remains unchanged. This could indicate a shift in regulatory mechanisms (e.g., reliance on distal elements), or that the lost accessibility at a specific site does not immediately impact overall transcript levels. |
| **Gained Accessibility, Unchanged RNA** | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | ∼ No Change | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | <2500 bp / >2500 bp | Chromatin becomes more accessible, but gene expression remains unchanged. This might indicate a "priming" event where the region is opened up in preparation for future activation, or that the accessibility change alone isn't sufficient to drive expression. |

(Note: If H3K27me3 is also present, it's a "bivalent" promoter, signaling developmental plasticity). The gene is prepared for activation but not highly expressed yet. Proximal to TSS. Usually unmethylated. |

This indicates a transcriptionally inactive or repressed genomic region, including inactive promoters and enhancers. Often associated with DNA hypermethylation and/or repressive histone marks (like H3K27me3). |
| **Weakly Active Enhancer** | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | ∼ Low/No | <span style="color: red;">↑</span> | ∼ Low | ∼ Low/No | <span style="color: blue;">↓</span> | >2500 bp | Open chromatin, H3K4me1 present, but H3K27ac at low levels. This could represent an enhancer with minimal activity or an enhancer that is just beginning to become active. Typically distal to TSS. |
