# Contributing

First of all, great that you're considering to contribute. Anything that you can contribute is highly appreciated! :thumbsup::tada:

This documented is inspired by the [carpentries contributing file](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

This project is open source and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
- fixes to existing material
- bug reports
- reviews of proposed changes are all welcome

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can, end help you become a member of our community.

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1.  If you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, or are willing to [create one](https://github.com/join), but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue](https://github.com/sib-swiss/single-cell-training/issues). This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.
2.  If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,  you can submit a pull request (PR). 

## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and improving existing ones  to providing feedback after teaching or learning from this course, and submitting [bug reports](https://github.com/sib-swiss/single-cell-training/issues) about things that don't work, aren't clear, or are missing. If you are looking for ideas, please see the 'Issues' tab for  a list of issues associated with this repository.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are smarter together than we are on our own. Reviews from novices and newcomers are particularly valuable: it's easy for people who have been using these courses for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so fresh eyes are always welcome.
